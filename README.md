# bootstrap-modules
This are some bootstrap modules I've implemented and reused for many jekyll websites.

Many times I've found myself reusing code for many of the websites I build for some of my customers. With this in mind, I decided to extract those sections into individual modules, so that I can easily add them to any website.

## List of contents
- **Carousel**: This module adds a bootstrap carousel, with auto-sliding thumbnails and arrows for control.
- **Grid Column**: This module adds a responsive layout that allows for the addition of items in a cascade-style.
- **Embed**: Simple module that supports embedding videos from youtube or vimeo.
